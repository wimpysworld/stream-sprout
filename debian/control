Description: Restream a video source to multiple destinations such as Twitch, YouTube, Owncast and Peertube.
 Stream Sprout is a simple, self-contained, and easy-to-use solution for
 streaming to multiple destinations such as Twitch, YouTube, Owncast and Peertube
 .
 It uses FFmpeg to receive the video stream from OBS Studio (or anything that
 can publish a RTMP stream) and then restreams it to multiple destinations;
 providing similar functionality as services like Restream.io and Livepush.io
 but without the need to pay for a third-party service or run something like
 nginx with the RTMP module.
 .
 Stream Sprout is configured with a simple YAML file and designed to be run on
 the same computer as your OBS Studio instance (it can be run remotely too) and
 does not require root privileges.
 .
 There is no transcoding or processing of the video stream. The stream is
 received and then restreamed to the destinations you configure without
 modification. Optionally you can also archive the stream to disk.
